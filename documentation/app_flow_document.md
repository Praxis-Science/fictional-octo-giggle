# App Flow Document

## Onboarding and Sign-In/Sign-Up

When a new user visits the platform, they are greeted by a clean, simple landing page that clearly explains the purpose of the Research Collaboration Platform. The first step for any user is to sign in using Discord OAuth. Instead of a traditional sign-up form, users are offered a prominent Discord login button that redirects them to Discord to authorize access. During this process, essential user details such as their Discord username are automatically retrieved and stored. Once authenticated, the user is seamlessly redirected back to the platform. Although a traditional username and password system is not present due to Discord OAuth integration, users still have an option to sign out from any page within the platform and, if needed, can reconnect through the same Discord authentication flow. There is no separate process for password recovery, as the reliance on Discord negates the need for local password management.

## Main Dashboard or Home Page

After successful login, the user arrives at the main dashboard, which serves as the central hub for navigating the platform. The design of this page is inspired by GitBook, with a minimal and clean layout featuring a top header and a sidebar navigation menu. On the dashboard, lead authors are warmly welcomed with an overview of their active research calls and a clear call-to-action to create a new call for co-authors. For co-author applicants, a list of active calls is easily accessible. The navigation elements are intuitive, allowing users to quickly move between creating a call, managing existing projects, and accessing additional settings or account information. This page sets the tone for a streamlined and efficient user experience, guiding users to their next step without any clutter.

## Detailed Feature Flows and Page Transitions

A core feature of the platform is the creation of a research call for co-authors. Lead authors make their way to a dedicated call creation page from the dashboard. On this page, they enter a preliminary research title, a brief summary, keywords, and select specific roles from a static list based on the CRediT taxonomy. After filling in all the required fields, the lead author submits the form, which triggers the generation of a unique URL. This URL is then automatically posted to a designated Discord channel, notifying potential co-authors in real time. The system also synchronizes user data from Discord to ensure that if an applicant is already in the system, their name and other details are auto-populated when they view the application page.

Following the posting, potential co-authors use the unique URL to navigate to the application page. Here, they see a form where they are prompted to select preferred roles, enter their name, email address, and optionally provide their ORCID ID. The form is designed to auto-populate available details if the applicant has already logged in through Discord. On submission of their application, an email notification is automatically sent to the lead author using a lightweight email service. This flow connects all pages seamlessly, allowing users to easily transition from creating a call to applying as a co-author. Additionally, lead authors have the ability to navigate to an edit page from the dashboard where they can update research call details or add publication links. Once the research project is concluded, they can close the call, which invalidates the unique URL, thus preventing further applications.

In addition, an administrative section is built into the system. Admin users have dedicated permissions to oversee overall operations, manage users, and review project submissions. Admins can access specific pages where they see system alerts and detailed logs, ensuring that the platform remains secure and functions according to the standard security measures in place.

## Settings and Account Management

Users have access to a settings page where they can manage their personal information, such as updating their display name or linking their ORCID ID for additional academic details. This section also provides options to update preferences, such as notification settings for email alerts, ensuring that the user experience is tailored to individual needs. For lead authors, the dashboard includes links to the project management page where further changes to active research calls can be made. Whether editing call details or adding publication links after a project is completed, the settings and management pages are integrated seamlessly so that users can return to the main dashboard with their updates immediately visible. Although traditional password management is not required due to the Discord integration, the account management area provides a clear route to sign out or reauthenticate as needed.

## Error States and Alternate Paths

At any point in the user journey, if a user enters invalid data or if there is a loss of connectivity, the system is designed to provide clear and understandable error messages. For instance, if a lead author fails to complete a required field when creating a research call, the form immediately highlights the error in plain language. Similarly, if a unique URL is accessed after a research call has been closed, the user is directed to a friendly fallback page that explains the project is no longer active. In cases of connectivity issues, users receive prompt notifications and guidance on retrying their actions. The system is built to handle restricted actions gracefully, and any attempt to perform unauthorized actions by non-admin users triggers an informative message that guides them back to a valid workflow. Overall, error states are handled in a way that minimizes frustration and keeps the user on track.

## Conclusion and Overall App Journey

The overall journey of the application begins from the moment a user lands on the platform and is guided through a seamless authentication process powered by Discord OAuth. Once logged in, the user is taken to a clean and intuitive dashboard from where they can choose to either create a new research call or apply as a co-author. Lead authors enjoy a streamlined process for setting up calls, being notified through Discord and email, and managing their ongoing projects through an easy-to-navigate management interface. Applicants experience a smooth, auto-populated form that reduces repetitive data entry, thanks to the integration with Discord. Administrative users have their own dedicated spaces to ensure the system runs smoothly and securely. In essence, the journey from initial access to day-to-day interactions is simple, connected, and designed to facilitate effective research collaboration while keeping the interface minimal, clean, and user-friendly.
