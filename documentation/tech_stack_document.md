# Tech Stack Document

This document explains the technology choices for our Research Collaboration Platform in everyday language. Each section is crafted to help non-technical users understand what is being used and why it is important for the project.

## Frontend Technologies

Our platform uses modern web tools to create a clean, user-friendly interface with a minimalist design inspired by GitBook. Here are the key technologies used on the frontend:

*   **Next.js**

    *   This framework helps us build a fast, server-rendered website with smooth transitions between pages, much like browsing through a sleek digital book.

*   **Tailwind CSS**

    *   A styling tool that lets us easily create a clean and simple design. It gives us the flexibility to adapt the look and feel efficiently.

*   **Typescript**

    *   A version of JavaScript that adds a layer of safety by catching errors early, which means a more reliable experience for users.

*   **Shadcn UI**

    *   A collection of pre-built, accessible UI components that speeds up development and ensures a consistent user interface throughout the platform.

Together, these tools allow us to deliver a polished front-end experience that is simple, fast, and responsive.

## Backend Technologies

Behind the scenes, our application relies on robust technologies to manage all the data and business logic. Here’s what powers our backend:

*   **Supabase**

    *   Acts as our backend service, offering a streamlined way of interacting with the database and real-time features if needed.

*   **Clerk Auth**

    *   Provides secure and scalable user authentication. It ensures that login and user management are both safe and easy to handle. This is particularly important as users log in using Discord OAuth.

*   **Node.js and Express (Underlying Concepts)**

    *   While our frontend platform is built on modern frameworks like Next.js, the underlying backend concepts still use Node.js with Express ideas. This ensures that when needed, the platform can handle server-side logic, API requests, and integration with other services.

*   **SQLite**

    *   A lightweight database option that is simple to use and perfect for our minimum viable product (MVP). It keeps the data storage efficient and easy to manage.

These backend choices ensure that the application is both lightweight and reliable, handling data and user requests smoothly.

## Infrastructure and Deployment

For hosting and deployment, we have chosen solutions that balance performance and simplicity:

*   **Linux-based Cloud Server**

    *   We host the application on a reliable Linux-based cloud server, ensuring consistent uptime and scalability as users increase.

*   **CI/CD Pipelines**

    *   Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment processes are set up so that updates are deployed efficiently and safely without interrupting the user experience.

*   **Version Control Systems (GitHub Repository)**

    *   All the project code is maintained in a version-controlled environment. This makes collaboration easier and ensures that any changes go through proper review before being deployed.

These choices make certain that our deployment process is robust, secure, and capable of handling growth over time.

## Third-Party Integrations

To extend the platform’s functionality and simplify certain tasks, several third-party services are integrated:

*   **Discord OAuth and Data Synchronization**

    *   Users log in via Discord, and the system automatically retrieves essential details (like usernames) from Discord. This also helps in auto-populating application forms for registered users.

*   **Email Service Integration**

    *   We plan to use a lightweight email service (such as SendGrid or Mailgun) for sending notifications to lead authors when a new application is received. This ensures timely updates and reliable communication.

*   **Optional ORCID Integration**

    *   There is an optional feature for users to enter their ORCID ID. This can later be used to pull in additional academic details, further enhancing user profiles and simplifying data entry.

These third-party integrations help us maintain a smooth and automated workflow, reducing manual steps and potential errors.

## Security and Performance Considerations

Security and performance are at the heart of our tech choices to ensure a safe and enjoyable user experience:

*   **Authentication & Data Protection**

    *   Implementing Discord OAuth and Clerk Auth guarantees that users are securely authenticated. Standard encryption practices are followed to protect data both in transit and at rest.

*   **Performance Optimizations**

    *   Using Next.js and Tailwind CSS allows for fast page loads and smooth transitions. The lightweight nature of SQLite and Supabase helps keep the backend responsive, even as the system scales.

*   **Error Handling & Scalability**

    *   Modern frameworks and services enable us to handle errors gracefully. Although our current system is designed to be minimal, we keep scalability in mind for future enhancements.

These measures ensure that the platform is secure against common vulnerabilities while also providing a fast, reliable service to our users.

## Conclusion and Overall Tech Stack Summary

The chosen technologies for our Research Collaboration Platform form a strong and modern tech stack that is simple yet powerful:

*   **Frontend:** Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Typescript, Shadcn UI. These technologies create a visually appealing, responsive, and easy-to-navigate interface.
*   **Backend:** Supabase, Clerk Auth, concepts from Node.js with Express, and SQLite. Together, they provide a secure, lightweight, and effective environment for managing data and user interactions.
*   **Infrastructure:** A Linux-based cloud server, CI/CD pipelines, and version control through GitHub ensure reliability, scalability, and streamlined deployment.
*   **Third-Party Integrations:** Seamless Discord OAuth, robust email notifications (via SendGrid/Mailgun), and optional ORCID integration enhance automation and interactivity, reducing repetitive tasks and simplifying data management.

This well-thought-out tech stack is perfectly aligned with our project goals of creating a minimally complex, intuitive, and highly functional Research Collaboration Platform. By combining state-of-the-art tools with reliable services, we are set to deliver an engaging experience for all our users, from lead authors to co-author applicants and administrators alike.
